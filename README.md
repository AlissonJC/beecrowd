# Beecrowd / URI Online Judge

Beecrowd (former URI Online Judge) is a website where programmers can solve many problems and contests to explore and evolve their skills on programming, algorithms, data structures, and many other important subjects in order to develop a great problem-solver professional.

# This repository

In this repository I share my solved problems using Python 3. The name of the file is the number of the problem. To access the problem just use the following link:

https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/{problem_number}

Just change *{problem_number}* for the number file you want to check e.g.:
https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1247

# Motivation

In order to achieve a better understanding of my programming skills and to contribute to our community I decided to share my accepted submissions.
It's a way to keep tracking what I have already done and to serve as an answer archive to those trying to solve the problems.

# Build Status

Beta forever.

*Just kidding.*

As long as Beecrowd has new problems, this repository will be in an ever-changing status.

# Tech / Framework used

__Python 3__ using only built-in libraries.

# How to use?

If you need a hand to solve any Beecrowd problem, don't just copy-paste these solutions.
Read them, understand them, and then try to develop a solution form your mind.

Feel free to test my solutions.
